# schoolLandingPage

```
This is a landing page built with HTMl, SCSS and jQuery.
The overall layout was built by utilizing the power of CSS grid which made both responsiveness and architecture of the website easy to carry out.
Advanced CSS (SCSS) was used to build each section and some components of the page and the BEM notation was also utilized to make the styling easier and more orderly.
jQuery was only used on the navigation bar for two reasons namely:- 1. To actualize a scrolltop effect for the background color 2. To achieve navbar responsiveness by application of the toggleClass() method. All this can be seen in the index.js file of the code.
